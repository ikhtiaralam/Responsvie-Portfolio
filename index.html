            <p><img class="profile" src="images/DSC05393.JPG" width="300" height="199"> My name is Ikhtiar Alam. I'm 26 years old and I live in Denton, TX. I was born in a smalltown in Queens, New York named Elmhurst. I was born at the local Elmhurst Hospital. I didn't know much about 
            New York because my family moved here in 1997 when I was just 4 years old. I went to elementary, middle, and high school here in Denton, Texas. Although I started my college career at University of Texas at Dallas, I had completed my long venture for 
          a bachelor's degree at University of North Texas.  </p>

            
            <p>After I graudated I took a year to calculate my options for a professional degree. I had applied to nursing school a year after I graduated and had gotten deferred acceptance for the 2019 fall cycle. 
              But I kept my options opens because I'm motivated by many things, not just in the health professions field. I love to learn and I love to network. My skills are only limited to what I myself limit them to
              and not by any conditoned mentality. I decided to look into the information technology field and stumbled upon SMU's Coding Bootcamp. And now here I am, working on my first official assignment with many more to come.
